# Atomoos
Atomas clone written in C++11 and (hopefully) modern OpenGL using freeglut and glew.

It's still very WIP: the OpenGL part is almost done but I havent implemented any game mechanic yet. 
The code is quite messy but it's my first time with "complex" C++ and OpenGL, so be kind.

This is a VS2015 project and uses the NupenGL package (from NuGet) to automagically get the needed libs so it's windows only for now. 
A Linux/OSX/whatever port should be quite straightforward though since there is no platform-dependent code.
